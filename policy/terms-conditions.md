**Terms of Service – Palactix**  
*Last updated: December 3, 2025*

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using Palactix ("Service," "Platform," or "we"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you are using the Service on behalf of an agency or organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity.

We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Check this page periodically.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be 18+ or the age of majority in your jurisdiction. Agencies must have a registered business. You agree to provide accurate information and not impersonate others.

## 3. Account Registration

To use the Service, create an account with valid email and password. You are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your credentials. Notify us immediately of unauthorized access.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations.

## 4. Service Description

Palactix provides a white-label social publishing platform for agencies to schedule and publish content across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), and Facebook. Key features:

- BYO (Bring Your Own) developer app credentials for OAuth authentication.
- Custom consent screens showing your agency name (not Palactix).
- Client folders, team seats, and scheduling queues.
- Plans: Starter ($199/mo), Pro ($799/mo), Scale ($1,999+/mo).

You may integrate with third-party APIs (e.g., Meta Graph API), but you are responsible for compliance with those platforms' terms.

## 5. BYO Credentials & Token Handling

- **Your Responsibility**: You provide your own developer app credentials (App ID, Secret) for connected platforms. You must obtain approvals from those platforms (e.g., Meta App Review).
- **Token Usage**: We use your credentials to authenticate and publish on your behalf. Tokens are encrypted at rest (AES-256) and isolated per agency. We do not access or store plaintext credentials.
- **Consent**: By providing credentials, you consent to us using them as your service provider per platform policies (e.g., Meta's Data Use Policy). You can revoke anytime.
- **Risks**: We throttle and queue requests to minimize ban risks, but platforms may revoke tokens or flag accounts. You are responsible for compliance; we disclaim liability for platform actions.
- **Revocation**: Revoke tokens via dashboard to disconnect clients. We delete tokens immediately upon request.

## 6. Custom Domains (Pro/Scale Plans)

- Pro/Scale users can configure custom domains (e.g., app.youragency.com) via CNAME records to our servers.
- You are responsible for DNS setup, SSL certificates, and domain renewal. We provide SSL termination but disclaim liability for misconfigurations or downtime.
- Custom domains do not change API endpoints; requests proxy through our infrastructure.

## 7. User Content

You own content you upload or publish (e.g., posts, media). You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive license to store, transmit, and display it for the Service.

You represent that content does not violate laws, platform policies, or third-party rights. We may remove violating content without notice.

## 8. Payments & Billing

- Plans billed monthly or annually via Paddle. Prices: Starter $199/mo, Pro $799/mo, Scale custom.
- Trials: 14 days free, no card required. Upgrade to paid for full access.
- Refunds: 30 days money-back for first subscription if unsatisfied. No refunds for custom work or abuse.
- Taxes: You pay all taxes. Paddle handles VAT/GST.
- Cancellation: Cancel anytime via dashboard; access ends at period end.

## 9. Prohibited Conduct

- Do not: Reverse-engineer, scrape, or interfere with the Service.
- Do not use for spam, illegal content, or violating platform policies (e.g., Meta's Terms).
- Do not share credentials with unauthorized parties.
- We may suspend accounts for violations without refund.

## 10. Intellectual Property

We own the Service, including code, designs, and trademarks. You own your content and agency branding (e.g., custom app names/logos).

## 11. Third-Party Services

The Service integrates with social platforms. Their terms apply (e.g., Meta's Developer Policy). We are not liable for their actions (e.g., token revocations).

## 12. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided "as is." We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including accuracy or uninterrupted access. Platforms may change APIs, causing disruptions—we'll mitigate but not guarantee.

## 13. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, client losses). Total liability limited to fees paid in prior 12 months.

## 14. Indemnification

You indemnify us against claims arising from your content, credentials, or use (e.g., platform bans due to violations).

## 15. Termination

We may terminate for violations. You may terminate anytime. Upon termination, access ends; data retained 30 days for export.

## 16. Governing Law

These Terms governed by laws of India, without conflict principles. Disputes resolved in Mumbai courts. EU users: Subject to GDPR.

## 17. Arbitration (US Users)

For US users, disputes resolved by binding arbitration in Mumbai under Indian Arbitration Act, not class actions.

## 18. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement. No waiver unless written. Severability: Invalid provisions don't affect others.
